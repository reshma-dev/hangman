## Introduction
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

The purpose of this project is to gain experience using the Python programming language - use of functions, conditionals and loops, class and the access modifiers.

## Installation Instructions
Standard Python Installation is enough to run this game, it does not need any extra packages to be installed.

## Usage Instructions
- Run the file `milestone_5.py`
- The program picks a word from list of fruits and asks the user to guess a letter at a time
- The game starts with 5 lives, and every incorrect guess costs 1 life.
- Each correct guess is displayed in the word at the location to help guessing the rest of the letters of the word

## Next Steps
The program currently uses a hard-coded list of 5 fruits and picks one word from it randomly

Code has been structured so that it can be easily extended to work off any other list to make it more realistic
